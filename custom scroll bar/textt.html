<h1 align="center">Jack-ma failure story</h1>
<body>
    <p style="font-size:30px;"> Jack Ma as an extremely lucky bloke who just became a billionaire in a snap. But it is safe to know that Rejections are synonymous with Jack Ma. You wouldn’t believe the number of times this man has been rejected and failed.

        In his early childhood, Jack Ma Failed his Primary School examinations, not once but twice!  He Failed Thrice during his Middle School exams. When applying to universities after High school, Jack failed the entrance exams thrice before finally joining Hangzhou Normal University. He even applied and wrote to Harvard University ten times about being admitted – and got rejected each time. This was only during his education!
        
        During and after his Bachelor’s degree Jack tried and failed to get a job at many places. After spending three years to get into a University, Jack failed to land a job after applying to them 30 times! He recollects in his interview, “When KFC came to China, 24 people went for the job.  Twenty-three people were accepted.  I was the only guy who wasn’t.” He was also one of the 5 applicants for a job in the Police force and was the only one getting rejected after being told, “No, you’re no good.”
        
        Also, in his entrepreneurial undertakings, Jack Ma went on to fail in two of his initial ventures. But that didn’t stop him in any way from dreaming bigger.
        <p style="font-size:30px;">
            In one of his interviews, when asked about his rejections, this is what he had to say, “Well, I think we have to get used to it.  We’re not that good.” Overcoming the pain of rejections and treating rejections as opportunities to learn and grow was what Jack Ma made of it.

After finally coming to terms with all of his rejections and failures, Jack Ma visited US in 1995, for a Government undertaking project related to the building of highways. Then, Jack Ma was first introduced to the Internet and Computers. Computers were pretty rare in China then, given the high costs associated with them and Internet or E-mails were non-existent. The first word he searched on the Mosaic browser was ‘Beer’, and it popped out results from different countries, but signs of China anywhere. He then searched ‘China,’ and not a single result popped out! He decided it was time for China and its people to get on the Internet.

<p style="font-size:30px;">Finally, after persuading 17 of his other friends to invest and join him in his new e-commerce startup – Alibaba, the company began from his apartment. Initially, Alibaba didn’t had a single penny in investment from outside investors, but they later raised $20 Million from SoftBank and another $5 Million from Goldman Sachs in 1999. Building trust among the people of China that an online system of payment and package transfers is safe was the biggest challenge Jack Ma and Alibaba faced, a challenge that Jack will cherish for his lifetime.</p>
